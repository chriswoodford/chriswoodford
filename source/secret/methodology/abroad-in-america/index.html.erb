      <cite>Abroad in America: Visitors to the New Nation, 1776-1914</cite> is a
      book written in 1976 by Marc Pachter. It's a book about people who came to
      visit American during its formative years, documenting their thoughts and
      opinions of this new nation. The reason that this is relevant to
      <cite>The Secret</cite> is that there are two exact quotations from
      <cite>Abraod in America</cite> embedded within two of the verses.

    <%= section_title "The Connection" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      As far as I can tell, q4t user <cite>forest_blight</cite> was the first to
      make the connection between <cite>The Secret</cite> and
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. He was able to tie 3 lines from Verse 2,
      to a passage in <cite>Abroad in America</cite>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/07-new-orleans/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Here is a sovereign people<br>
        Who build palaces to shelter<br>
        Their heads for a night!
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 49" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From <cite>Abroad in America</cite>:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/abroadinamericav00pach/page/110" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Here is the sovereign people who build palaces to shelter their heads
        for a night!
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Abroad in America", reference: "pg. 110" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the exception of a single word (i.e. a vs the), the quotation is an
      exact match. This raises the question: why would Priess include an exact
      quote from this book? Another q4t user, <cite>Egbert</cite> asked:
      <q>What would be the purpose of putting in these references which no one
      could figure out?</q>
      The underlying assumption here being that <cite>Abroad in America</cite>
      would have been an obscure reference in 1982.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Perhaps by 2007 the book's 15 minutes of fame had been all but forgotten,
      but in 1976, it was very popular within academic circles. The book was
      released as part of a
      <q cite="<%= current_page.data.abroad_url %>">3-part Bicentennial exhibition</q>
      at the National Portrait Gallery (Smithsonian Institute) in
      Washington, DC. People came from all over the world to view the
      exhibition. For example,
      <q cite="https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_396622">Dr. and Mrs. Hiroshi Nakahama</q>,
      who came from Japan. There was even a big article about it in the
      <cite>
        <% link_to "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/04/26/smithsonian-gathering" do %>
        April 26, 1976 edition of the New Yorker.
        <% end %>
      </cite>
      Not to mention that the hints from the Japanese edition of
      <cite>The Secret</cite> refer to it as
      <q cite="https://12treasures.com/2019/01/10/236/">a famous book</q>. To
      this day, a quick Google search will bring up results of academic papers
      that make reference to <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. I think it fair to
      say that at least the intelligentsia, including Priess, considered
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> to be a big deal in its time.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      We know Byron Priess as a publisher and an author, as well as a creator of
      one the of the most challenging puzzles of all time. I don't think
      it is a stretch to consider him an academic, as someone who would have
      read <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, or someone who would be up to date with
      the current exhibitions at the Smithsonian. It does not seem unlikely
      for him to, not only be intimately familiar with the book, but also to
      have referred to it as famous.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It also does not seem all that far fetched to think that a book about
      <cite>Visitors to the New Nation</cite> (i.e. America), would play a role
      within a mythology based on immigration to America.

    <%= section_title "Explicit References" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the previous section I outlined the exact quote from
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> that is embedded within Verse 2. In
      context, the quote is a reference to the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans,
      Louisiana from 1847. The assumption here is that this three line stanza,
      is a reference to ultimately tie Verse 2 to Painting 7, through the quote
      in <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. The latitude/longitude hint in
      Painting 7 (29 / 90) gets us roughly to New Orleans. The <cite>Abroad in
      America</cite> hint in the Verse gets us to the St. Charles Hotel in New
      Orleans. That's a strong connection.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The second explicit reference related to Verse 6:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/02-charleston/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Edwin and Edwina named after him
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 51" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From <cite>Abroad in America</cite>:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/abroadinamericav00pach/page/164" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        [H]e even had twin babies named after him, Edwin and Edwina Wilmont
        Blyden
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Abroad in America", reference: "pg. 164" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This quote is taken from a section about a trip that Edward Blyden made to
      Charleston, South Carolina, in 1889. Again we see a quote from <cite>Abroad
      in America</cite> being used as a confirmation of the city. Painting 2 has
      a number of image confirmers for Charleston, such as map of Charleston in
      the mask, a representation of Fort Sumter, and latitude/longitude numbers
      in the lion's mane and whiskers. With such clear connections to Charleston
      in the image, perhaps BP wanted to put a more opaque reference to
      Charleston in the verse. The quote about an event from Blyden's time in
      Charleston definitively connects the Verse 6 to Painting 2 through
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the 1980s one of the only places to do the work required to solve The
      Secret was the library. Given the overarching theme of the history of
      immigration to the West within the story, it seems likely that we might
      have used the Dewey Decimal System's 900 class (History &amp; Geography)
      to look for other books about history and immigration. That's where we
      would have found <cite>Abroad in America</cite>, right at
      <cite>917.3/04/0922</cite>.
