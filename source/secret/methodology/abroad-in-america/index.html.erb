      <cite>Abroad in America: Visitors to the New Nation, 1776-1914</cite> is a
      book written in 1976 by Marc Pachter. It's a book about people who came to
      visit American during its formative years, documenting their thoughts and
      opinions of this new nation. The reason that this is relevant to
      <cite>The Secret</cite> is that there are two exact quotations from
      <cite>Abraod in America</cite> embedded within two of the verses.

    <%= section_title "The Connection" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      As far as I can tell, q4t user <cite>forest_blight</cite> was the first to
      make the connection between <cite>The Secret</cite> and
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. He was able to tie 3 lines from Verse 2,
      to a passage in <cite>Abroad in America</cite>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/07-new-orleans/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Here is a sovereign people<br>
        Who build palaces to shelter<br>
        Their heads for a night!
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 49" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From <cite>Abroad in America</cite>:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/abroadinamericav00pach/page/110" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Here is the sovereign people who build palaces to shelter their heads
        for a night!
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Abroad in America",
                          reference: "pg. 110" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the exception of a single word (i.e. a vs the), the quotation is an
      exact match. This raises the question: why would Priess include an exact
      quote from this book? Another q4t user, <cite>Egbert</cite> asked:
      <q>What would be the purpose of putting in these references which no one
      could figure out?</q>
      The underlying assumption here being that <cite>Abroad in America</cite>
      would have been an obscure reference in 1982.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Perhaps by 2007 the book's 15 minutes of fame had been all but forgotten,
      but in 1976, it was very popular within academic circles. The book was
      released as part of a
      <q cite="<%= current_page.data.abroad_url %>">3-part Bicentennial exhibition</q>
      at the National Portrait Gallery (Smithsonian Institute) in
      Washington, DC. People came from all over the world to view the
      exhibition. For example,
      <q cite="https://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_arc_396622">Dr. and Mrs. Hiroshi Nakahama</q>,
      who came from Japan. There was even a big article about it in the
      <cite>
        <% link_to "https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1976/04/26/smithsonian-gathering" do %>
        April 26, 1976 edition of the New Yorker.
        <% end %>
      </cite>
      Not to mention that the hints from the Japanese edition of
      <cite>The Secret</cite> refer to it as
      <q cite="https://12treasures.com/2019/01/10/236/">a famous book</q>. To
      this day, a quick Google search will bring up results of academic papers
      that make reference to <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. I think it fair to
      say that at least the intelligentsia, including Priess, considered
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> to be a big deal in its time.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      We know Byron Priess as a publisher and an author, as well as a creator of
      one the of the most challenging puzzles of all time. I don't think
      it is a stretch to consider him an academic, as someone who would have
      read <cite>The New Yorker</cite>, or someone who would be up to date with
      the current exhibitions at the Smithsonian. It does not seem unlikely
      for him to, not only be intimately familiar with the book, but also to
      have referred to it as famous.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It also does not seem all that far fetched to think that a book about
      <cite>Visitors to the New Nation</cite> (i.e. America), would play a role
      within a mythology based on immigration to America.
    <% end %>

    <%= section_title "Explicit References" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the previous section I outlined the exact quote from
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> that is embedded within Verse 2. In
      context, the quote is a reference to the St. Charles Hotel in New Orleans,
      Louisiana from 1847. The assumption here is that this three line stanza,
      is a reference to ultimately tie Verse 2 to Painting 7, through the quote
      in <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. The latitude/longitude hint in
      Painting 7 (29 / 90) gets us roughly to New Orleans. The <cite>Abroad in
      America</cite> hint in the Verse gets us to the St. Charles Hotel in New
      Orleans. That's a strong connection.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The second explicit reference related to Verse 6:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/02-charleston/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Edwin and Edwina named after him
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 51" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From <cite>Abroad in America</cite>:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/abroadinamericav00pach/page/164" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        [H]e even had twin babies named after him, Edwin and Edwina Wilmont
        Blyden
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Abroad in America",
                          reference: "pg. 164" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This quote is taken from a section about a trip that Edward Blyden made to
      Charleston, South Carolina, in 1889. Again we see a quote from <cite>Abroad
      in America</cite> being used as a confirmation of the city. Painting 2 has
      a number of image confirmers for Charleston, such as map of Charleston in
      the mask, a representation of Fort Sumter, and latitude/longitude numbers
      in the lion's mane and whiskers. With such clear connections to Charleston
      in the image, perhaps BP wanted to put a more opaque reference to
      Charleston in the verse. The quote about an event from Blyden's time in
      Charleston definitively connects the Verse 6 to Painting 2 through
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>.
    <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Hidden References" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The question now is whether Priess would stop at two references to
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. If there are additional references, they
      are not as explicit as the two mentioned above, i.e. there are no
      remaining exact quotes from the book in any of the verses. In order to
      find any references, we will need to do some investigation and draw some
      connections. After all, this is a puzzle; some times we might just need to
      put the right pieces together.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One of the most interesting pieces of information that really helped me
      solidify this theory came from a user on the 12 Treasures Facebook Group,
      <cite>Carly Perales</cite>. He proposed a really intriguing analysis of
      Verse 6 and Verse 10 (New York). In this analsyis, he shows a number of
      structural similarities between these two verses.
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        insert reference from facebook quote
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "",
                          reference: "" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      His conclusion from this connection is that the solution for Charleston is
      going to be similar to to the solution for New York. Although I do tend to
      agree with that conclusion, further discussion it outside of the scope of
      this article.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      My main takeaway from his analysis pointed me back towards
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. If there is an explicit reference to the
      book in Verse 6 and we accept that there is a connection between Verse 6
      and Verse 10, then it follows that there may be an
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> reference buried within Verse 10.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      If there is a reference in Verse 10, the place that seemed the most
      obvious to start is arguably the most cryptic lines of all the verses:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        The natives still speak<br>
        Of him of Hard word in 3 Vols.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "",
                          reference: "" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With such a cryptic reference, it requires a lot of unpacking. Starting
      with the second line, you can see that it reads very oddly. It is an
      English sentence, but when you read it, it just does not make any sense.
      It is so strange because it is missing words. From my own research into
      <q>Hard word</q> and <q>3 Vols</q>, I believe the line can be unpacked to:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Of him [, the author] of Hard [Times, published in Household] word[s] in
        3 Vol[ume]s.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      All of a sudden, the sentence makes sense; it reads much more like a
      run of the mill English sentence. It also points us to an actual person:
      Charles Dickens. Dickens first published his work <cite>Hard Times</cite>
      split into three volumes in his own publication called
      <cite>Household Words</cite>. It fits the line pretty well.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      If you're still skeptical about this interpretation, we can review the
      Japanese hint for this line, which I believe also points to Dickens via
      the same process of filling in the missing words.
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        insert japanese hint
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Starting with the word <q>Chicken</q> and applying the same expansion
      process to it, we get:
      <q>Ch[arles D]icken[s]</q><%= footnote_tag(index: 1) %>. Again, the word
      play seems to fit pretty well.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Preiss has given us a line about Charles Dickens and is telling us that
      <q>the natives still speak of him</q>. Before getting to deep into
      questions about these natives, let's circle back to
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite>. Chapter 9 is all about Charles Dickens,
      specifically about the time that Dickens came to America. It describes the
      places he visited, the friends he made, and his impression of America at
      the time.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Remember from Verses 2 and 6, that the purpose of the
      <cite>Abroad in America</cite> reference was to confirm the city. If we
      have another reference here in Verse 10, then it seems fair to assume that
      the purpose of this reference is also to confirm the city. That would mean
      that the <q>natives</q> referred to in the line prior, are the natives of
      the city that Verse 10 belongs to.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In order to come to a conclusion about what city this is referring to, we
      need to dig into Chapter 9.
      ? what cities are referenced
      ? can we get new york from abroad in america alone
      ? do we need to make the blackwell island reference

      The author of this chapter,
      <cite>INSERT NAME</cite> heavily references Dickens'
      <cite>American Notes</cite> published in 1894, which was Dickens'
      own account of his journey in America. The connection from Verse 10, to
      Dickens, to <cite>Abroad in America</cite> gets us to
      <cite>American Notes</cite>.
