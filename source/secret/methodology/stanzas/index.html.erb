      Once the verses have been
      <%= link_to "destructured into their composite stanzas",
                  current_page.data.verse_structure_path,
                  class: "underline" %>,
      it starts to become apparent that there are similarities in the types of
      instructions that each stanza is providing, from verse to verse.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the sections following, I will outline what I believe are the major
      Stanza categories, such as: the Starting Point Stanza; the Dig Site
      Stanza; the Locator Stanza; and the Waypoint Stanza.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Starting Point Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Within each verse, there is a stanza that describes the point where Preiss
      expected you to start your path to the casque. Both Verses 4 and 12 have
      the Starting Point Stanza as the first stanza. Prior to the Boston casque
      being found, I believed that the Starting Point Stanza was always the
      first stanza of the verse. As more information about the Boston solution
      has come to light, I believe that pattern does not hold true for Verse 3.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It is interesting to note that with both Chicago and Boston, the
      Starting Point stanza corresponded to the entrance to the area of interest
      (i.e. Grant Park and Langone Park, respectively). Cleveland is a bit
      different. MLK Blvd, where the Starting Point stanza puts us, runs through
      the center of the greater park (Cleveland Cultural Gardens), though it
      does put us at the entrance to the Greek and Italian Gardens (a sub-area
      of the greater park). The only thing that can be conclusively said about
      these three verses, is that the Starting Point stanza puts you at the
      entrance to <em>something</em>. Whether that is the park, or an area
      within a the park, will need special interpretation.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Another interesting point is that all three of the starting point stanzas,
      based on this interpretation, are couplets (i.e. stanzas of two lines).

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Chicago" %>

      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 12, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Where M and B are set in stone<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One interesting point about this stanza is that it is presented as a
      couplet (2 lines), but if you split lines every 4 syllables, it matches
      the pattern of the Ballad Stanza. This might just be Preiss' stylistic
      influence coming through, but it is worth noting.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From the hints in the Japanese translation, we know that the M and B are
      the names of song composers. This leads us to the Chicago Symphony
      Orchestra building, where Mozart and Beethoven are engraved in the
      building. This is only about 350 yards from the entrance to Grant Park,
      where the Chicago casque was found.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This couplet puts us on Martin Luther King Blvd (formerly Liberty Blvd),
      within the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, near the intersection with Parkgate
      Ave. The two countries referenced are Italy and Greece, since this stretch
      of MLK Blvd right before <q>the road curves</q> includes both the Greek
      and Italian Cultural Gardens. In this case, we are only about 250 feet
      from the casque location.

      The Starting Point for Verse 3 is a less obvious than the preceding two.
      I believe the Starting Point Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/11-cleveland/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A green tower of lights<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      These lines, on their own, do not scream "start here", in the same way
      that Chicago and Cleveland do. That this is the starting point really only
      comes to light within the context of the other stanzas and some clues from
      Painting 11. The other stanzas in this verse are more clearly aligned with
      the other stanza types (locator, dig site, waypoint), which makes this as
      the starting point a bit of a process of elimination.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This as the starting point really got hammered home in the Boston episode
      of <cite>Expedition Unknown</cite> when JJP mentions that the shape of the
      woman's hair in Painting 11 is shaped like a baseball diamond. Langone
      Park is basically just three baseball diamonds. We learn in the episode
      that it was, in fact, the middle baseball diamond where the casque was
      found. That solidifies that <q>the middle section</q> refers to the middle
      baseball diamond. The <q>green tower of lights</q> likely refers to the
      extremely green Maurice J. Tobin Memorial Bridge, which can be seen when
      standing at the entrance to the park at the second baseball diamond.

    <%= section_title "Locator Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The purpose of a Locator Stanza is to orient you within an area on a map.
      This is very similar to my theory that there are
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Boundary Markers", current_page.data.boundary_markers_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>
      within the paintings. This is the verse based equivalent. Preiss knew that
      maps would be one of the most readily available tools for narrowing down
      to a dig location. In many cases, the Locator Stanza, paired with the
      Boundary Markers from the Painting, then plotted on a map, give an
      extremely well-defined area of interest to search for the casque.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Since
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "the Verses are non-linear,",
                    current_page.data.non_linear_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>
      the Locator Stanza has shown to be one of the more confusing stanza types.
      If attempting to read the verses linearly, as a step-by-step guide, when
      you reach the Locator Stanza, it will appear extremely out of place. It
      will read as if Preiss was telling you to go to one area and then
      immediately telling you to go somewhere else.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Once you know what you're looking for, the Locator Stanza is relatively
      easy to spot, since Preiss used common key words to help identify them.
      Many of the verses have a stanza that uses one of: "near", "nearby",
      "not far a way", etc. All of these vague spatial references are intended
      to help you narrow your focus to the area of interest. They are too vague
      to be useful if treating the verse in the step-by-step fashion. Near...
      How near?! The interpretation of "near" is often what sends people
      following an incorrect path.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 12, the Locator Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        For finding jewel casque<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This stanza refers to three things that you are to "seek", in order to
      get close to the casque's location: rumble; brush; and music. To solve the
      riddle of a Locator Stanza, we need to look at a map and find somewhere
      that these three things are seen together. In this case, rumble refers to
      the Railway Line, brush refers to the Art Institute, and music refers to
      a bandshell (or perhaps the Symphony Orchestra). Looking on a map, you
      can see where all of these things are found together.

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this Verse, the Locator Stanza is also the last stanza. This aligns
      the the theory that the verses are not to be read in linear order, since
      you would not want to seek these things <em>after</em> having already
      found the 10 by 13 and the fence and fixture. If you passed the fence and
      fixture and continued in the direction of the Art Institute, you would
      pass right by the dig spot.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Cleveland" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 4, I believe that the Starting Point Stanza and the Locator
      Stanza are the same:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/04-cleveland/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Beneath two countries<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The reference to the curvature of the road is what hints towards this also
      acting as a Locator Stanza. If the interpretation of the Painting already
      has us looking in and around the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, it would not
      seem unreasonable to be looking at a map and see how Parkgate Ave curves
      right above the Italian Cultural Gardens.

      The most interesting piece is that the first two lines of Verse 4 have a
      dual meaning. That they both telling you the starting point and orient
      you on a map.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Boston" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The interesting thing about Verse 3 is that there are multiple locator
      stanzas, one of which appears to have two location references within it.
      I believe the locator stanzas are:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/11-boston/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Near those<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This one has the telltale sign of a locator stanza: <q>near</q>. This
      tells us to look on a map for something that can be referred to as a
      <q>coliseum with metal walls</q>. In the <cite>Expedition Unknown</cite>
      episode, they refer to an ice rink just west of the baseball diamond. I
      do not think that interpretation sits very well. An obscure ice rink in
      the general proximity of the casque site doesn't seem like something worth
      including. I'm more inclined to think of it as a reference to the Boston
      Garden, which is also in the North End and would act as an Eastern map
      boundary as you narrow in on Langone Park.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The second locator stanza is:

      The remaining four lines appear to refer to Paul Revere's midnight ride,
      April 18th, 1775. Few things could say Boston more conclusively than that.
      But even more interesting, is that Paul Revere's house and a Paul Revere
      statue are in Boston's North End, about 1/3rd of a mile from the casque
      site. These locations would be easy to identify on a map, getting you very
      close to the starting point.

      The Waypoint Stanza describes something that you pass on the way to the

      as it allows you to confirm that the path from the starting point to the
      dig location is correct.

      Both the Chicago and Cleveland verses have prominent Waypoint Stanzas that
      were key in getting to the dig site. It's also interesting to note that
      both of these Waypoint Stanzas actually make mention of the casque. For
      Verse 12, it's called the <q>treasure holder</q>, in Verse 4, it's just

      With Langone Park being so small, there aren't a lot of waypoints to
      mention on the way to the casque site. Unfortunately a lot of critical
      information about the last pieces of the puzzle were lost due to the
      construction at the park when the casque was found. However, we can piece
      some things together from the Painting and the previous solves. In
      Chicago, the <q>fence and fixture</q> reference in the verse and depicted
      in the Painting were not the dig site, but were <em>visible</em> from the
      dig site. From that we can infer that the home plate seen in Painting 11
      and referred to by <q>feel at home</q> was not the dig site, but were
      visible from the dig site.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Under that interpretation, the <q>face the water</q> and <q>back to the
      stairs</q> act as reference points, in the sense that they orient you
      before you head to the dig site. Although it is an extremely short
      distance, I do believe that home plate was in between the park entrance
      and the dig site, which would technically make it a waypoint.

      The intent of the Dig Site Stanza is to tell you how to dig up the casque

      stanza was not the last stanza of the verse. In many of the other verses,
      the Dig Site stanza does appear to be at the end of the verse. There does
      not appear to be any pattern to where it appears.

      Based on that quote, there might be verses with no Dig Site Stanza at all,
      relying solely on the Painting for information. Or, there might be verses
      that need to be used in tandem with Painting based clues to get the
      precise dig instructions. Worth keeping in mind for the exceptionally
      vague verse like Verse 7.

      As mentioned at the beginning of this article, I believe the Dig Site
      Stanza for Verse 12 is:
    <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        The end of ten by thirteen<br>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There's a bit of disagreement over the <q>ten by thirteen</q>, most
      believe that it is related to the tree line, that it was telling you to go
      to the intersection of a line of ten trees with a line of thirteen trees.
      I've also heard that Priess mentioned it as ten by thirteen feet. In any
      case, it is an explicit direction for where to go and start to dig.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The additional lines about <q>fence and fixture</q> actually tie the verse
      to something that you see near the dig site and to something that you see
      in the Painting. The last line <q>Central too</q>, is a reference to the
      Chicago Central Railroad, which runs right past the dig site.

      For Verse 4, the Dig Site Stanza is:

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The majority of Verse 4 is spent describing the instructions for the dig
      site. Preiss gives detailed and exact instructions for where to find the
      casque.

      For Verse 3, the dig site stanza is actually the first stanza. This has
      been a source of confusion for a long time and caused so many people to
      head in the wrong direction, because they interpreted this stanza as the
      beginning of the instructions.

      A lot of people interpret this as a locator stanza, referencing the Boston
      Public Library, which is a very likely connection. That said, I believe
      the real connection here is the literary one. Horace Walpole, in his
      letters, wrote:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/lettershoracewa01manngoog/page/n11" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        The next Augustan age will dawn on the other side of the Atlantic. There
        will, perhaps, be a Thucydides at Boston, a Xenophon at New York.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, to Sir Horace Mann",
                          reference: "pg. 370" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      We know Preiss has hidden literary references into many of the verses
      (see below). It also does not seem surprising that Preiss would be
      familiar with an author like Walpole, who was known for writing fairy
      tales. The Fair Folk are such an important part of the mythology of
      <cite>The Secret</cite>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Even if you don't accept the Walpole reference, all the information needed
      is in these lines. Thucydides is the subject. So if he is <em>north</em>
      of Xenophon, then
      <q>take five steps in the area of <em>his</em> direction</q> (emphasis
      added). This is telling us to take five steps north from our current
      location. That instruction only makes sense after we already
      <q>feel at home</q>, that is, when we are at home plate in the baseball
      diamond. Preiss is simply telling us to "take 5 steps north from home
      plate and dig".
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There are alternate interpretations of these lines, which treat them as
      the beginning. The gist being, start at the Boston Public Library where
      the names Thucydides and Xenophon are engraved on the wall (though let's
      not forget that those names are also on the wall of the Greek Pylon, next
      to Socrate, Pindar, and Apelles...), then go five subway stops or pass
      five wharfs, to lead to Langone Park. Although these may "work", it seems
      like forcing the details to fit the theory, rather than the other way
      around.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For example, there are actually 6 Wharfs between Columbus Park and Langone
      Park: Commercial, Lewis, Sargents, Union, Battery, and Constitution. I
      find it hard to believe that Preiss would expect us to know to "ignore"
      one of the wharfs, to count them as 5. At least harder to believe than the
      idea that Priess was referencing 1774 letter from an English author who
      wrote about fairy tales. It's also worth mentioning that 1774 Walpole
      letter was only a year before Paul Revere's ride (see above).

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      I cannot say that this list of stanza types is exhaustive, as I am sure
      there is still more to uncover. There may be other stanza types that are
      waiting to be identified.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One type that I have on my radar, but have not spent enough time
      analyzing, is the Literary Reference Stanza. Verses 2, 3, and 6, in
      particular, appear to have explicit references to works of literature,
      <cite>Treasure Island</cite> and <cite>Abroad in America</cite>
      respectively. There may even be as many as three more references to
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Abroad in America",
                    current_page.data.abroad_in_america_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>
      within the verses at large. Not to mention references to <cite>The Wizard
      of Oz</cite>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Over time I hope to do a deeper dive into these Verses and see what can
      be learned about them.

    <%= section_title "Conclusion" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Understanding the intent of each stanza is the first step to solving the
      riddles that Priess has encoded within them. Applying this framework of
      Stanza types across the verses will hopefully shed light on what Priess
      was trying to communicate through the verses to get us to the casques.
