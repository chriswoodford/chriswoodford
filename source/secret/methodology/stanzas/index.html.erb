      Once the verses have been
      <%= link_to "destructured into their composite stanzas",
                  current_page.data.verse_structure_path,
                  class: "underline" %>,
      it starts to become apparent that there are similarities in the types of
      instructions that each stanza is providing, from verse to verse.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the sections following, I will outline what I believe are the major
      Stanza categories, such as: the Starting Point Stanza; the Dig Site
      Stanza; the Locator Stanza; and the Path Stanza.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each verse has a different combination of these stanza types and you won't
      find an example of every stanza in every verse. In some cases, a single 
      stanza in a verse may embody two or more of the types. What's important is
      that we are able to identify the information that we're being given, so
      that we are more equiped to solve the puzzle.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Starting Point Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Within each verse, there is a stanza that describes the point where Preiss
      expected you to start your path to the casque. Both Verses 4 and 12 have
      the Starting Point Stanza as the first stanza. Prior to the Boston casque
      being found, I believed that the Starting Point Stanza was always the
      first stanza of the verse. As more information about the Boston solution
      has come to light, I believe that pattern does not hold true for all
      verses.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It is interesting to note that with both Chicago and Boston, the
      Starting Point stanza corresponded to the entrance to the area of interest
      (i.e. Grant Park and Langone Park, respectively). Cleveland is a bit
      different. MLK Blvd, where the Starting Point stanza puts us, runs through
      the center of the greater park (Cleveland Cultural Gardens), though it
      does put us at the entrance to the Greek and Italian Gardens (a sub-area
      of the greater park). The only thing that can be conclusively said about
      these three verses, is that the Starting Point stanza puts you at the
      entrance to <em>something</em>. Whether that is the park, or an area
      within a the park, will need special interpretation.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Another interesting point is that both the Chicago and Cleveland starting
      point stanzas, based on this interpretation, are couplets (i.e. stanzas of
      two lines).
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 12, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Where M and B are set in stone<br>
        And to Congress, R is known
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 54" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One interesting point about this stanza is that it is presented as a
      couplet (2 lines), where both lines rhyme.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From the hints in the Japanese translation, we know that the M and B are
      the names of famous composers. This leads us to the Chicago Symphony
      Orchestra building, where Mozart and Beethoven are engraved in the
      building. This is only about 350 yards from the entrance to Grant Park,
      where the Chicago casque was found.

      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 4, the first Stanza is:

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This couplet puts us on Martin Luther King Blvd (formerly Liberty Blvd),
      within the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, near the intersection with Parkgate
      Ave. The two countries referenced are Italy and Greece, since this stretch
      of MLK Blvd right before <q>the road curves</q> includes both the Greek
      and Italian Cultural Gardens. In this case, we are only about 250 feet
      from the casque location.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Locator Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The purpose of a Locator Stanza is to orient you within an area on a map.
      Preiss knew that maps would be one of the most readily available tools for
      narrowing down to a dig location.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Since
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "the Verses are non-linear,",
                    current_page.data.non_linear_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>
      the Locator Stanza has shown to be one of the more confusing stanza types.
      If attempting to read the verses linearly, as a step-by-step guide, when
      you reach the Locator Stanza, it appears extremely out of place. It reads
      as if Preiss was telling you to go to one area and then immediately
      telling you to go somewhere else.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Once you know what you're looking for, the Locator Stanza is relatively
      easy to spot, since Preiss used common key words to help identify them.
      Many of the verses have a stanza that uses one of: "near", "nearby",
      "not far a way", etc. All of these vague spatial references are his way
      of describing what was around him at the time that he was there. They are
      too vague to be useful if treating the verse in the step-by-step fashion.
      Near...How near?! The interpretation of "near" is often what sends people
      following an incorrect path.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 12, the Locator Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        For finding jewel casque<br>
        Seek the sounds<br>
        Of rumble<br>
        Brush and music<br>
        Hush.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This stanza refers to three things that you are to "seek", in order to
      get close to the casque's location: rumble; brush; music; and hush. To
      solve the riddle of a Locator Stanza, we often need to look at a map and
      find somewhere that these three things are seen together. In this case,
      <q>rumble</q> refers to the Railway Line, <q>brush</q> refers to the Art
      Institute, <q>music</q> refers to a bandshell (or perhaps the Symphony
      Orchestra), and <q>hush</q> refers to the Chicago Public Library.. Looking
      on a map, you can see where all of these things are found together.

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this Verse, the Locator Stanza is also the last stanza. This aligns
      the the theory that the verses are not to be read in linear order, since
      you would not want to seek these things <em>after</em> having already
      found the 10 by 13 and the fence and fixture. If you passed the fence and
      fixture and continued in the direction of the Art Institute, you would
      pass right by the dig spot.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Cleveland" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 4, I believe that the Starting Point Stanza and the Locator
      Stanza are the same:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/04-cleveland/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The reference to the curvature of the road is what hints towards this also
      acting as a Locator Stanza. If the interpretation of the Painting already
      has us looking in and around the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, it would not
      seem unreasonable to be looking at a map and see how Parkgate Ave curves
      right above the Italian Cultural Gardens.

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The most interesting piece is that the first two lines of Verse 4 have a
      dual meaning. That they both telling you the starting point and orient
      you on a map.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Path Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The Path Stanza describes how you get from the starting point to the dig
      site. This stanza often includes a waypoint or marker, which is how 
      Preiss lets you know that you are on the right path.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Both the Chicago and Cleveland verses have prominent Path Stanzas that
      were key in getting to the dig site. It's also interesting to note that
      both of these Path Stanzas actually make mention of the casque. For
      Verse 12, it's called the <q>treasure holder</q>, in Verse 4, it's just
      called <q>the casque</q>. I will look for this same pattern in other
      verse to help identify the Path Stanzas.

  <% section_tag do %>

      The L in question here is Lincoln, specifically a seated Lincoln statue in

      behind the statue, where the casque was buried.

      The names of these Greek writers are chiseled on a wall in the Greek

      seen these names. This is the confirmer that encourages you to continue
      on this path.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Dig Site Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The intent of the Dig Site Stanza is to tell you how to dig up the casque
      once you're in the right place. It is the "X marks the spot" of
      <cite>The Secret</cite>. In the cases of the 3 casques found, the Dig Site
      stanza was not the last stanza of the verse. In other verses, the Dig Site
      stanza does appear to be at the end of the verse. At this time, there
      is no clear pattern to where it will appear.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Some of the Dig Site stanzas are extremely explicit, going so far as to
      give exact numbers of steps or exact placement with respect to particular
      bricks. In other cases, the Dig Site stanzas are very vague, not giving
      any information about how or where to dig. There is a quote from Palencar
      to shed some light on this idea.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Based on that quote, there might be verses with no Dig Site Stanza at all,
      relying solely on the Painting for information. Or, there might be verses
      that need to be used in tandem with Painting based clues to get the
      precise dig instructions. Worth keeping in mind for the exceptionally
      vague verse like Verse 7.

      As mentioned at the beginning of this article, I believe the Dig Site

      <% paragraph_tag do %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There's a bit of disagreement over the <q>ten by thirteen</q>, most
      believe that it is related to the tree line, that it was telling you to go
      to the intersection of a line of ten trees with a line of thirteen trees.
      I've also heard that Priess mentioned it as ten by thirteen feet. In any
      case, it is an explicit direction for where to go and start to dig.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The additional lines about <q>fence and fixture</q> actually tie the verse
      to something that you see near the dig site and to something that you see
      in the Painting. The last line <q>Central too</q>, is a reference to the
      Chicago Central Railroad, which runs right past the dig site.

      For Verse 3, the dig site stanza is actually the first stanza. This has

      head in the wrong direction, because they interpreted this stanza as the
      beginning of the instructions.

      A lot of people interpret this as a locator stanza, referencing the Boston
      Public Library, which is a very reasonable connection. That said, I
      believe the real connection here is the literary one. Horace Walpole, in
      his letters, wrote:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://archive.org/details/lettershoracewa01manngoog/page/n11" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        The next Augustan age will dawn on the other side of the Atlantic. There
        will, perhaps, be a Thucydides at Boston, a Xenophon at New York.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Letters of Horace Walpole, Earl of Orford, to Sir Horace Mann",
                          reference: "pg. 370" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      We know Preiss has hidden literary references into many of the verses
      (see below). It also does not seem surprising that Preiss would be
      familiar with an author like Walpole, who was known for writing fairy
      tales. The Fair Folk are such an important part of the mythology of
      <cite>The Secret</cite>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Even if you don't accept the Walpole reference, all the information needed
      is in these lines. Thucydides is the subject. So if he is <em>north</em>
      of Xenophon, then
      <q>take five steps in the area of <em>his</em> direction</q> (emphasis
      added). This is telling us to take five steps north from our current
      location. That instruction only makes sense after we already
      <q>feel at home</q>, that is, when we are at home plate in the baseball
      diamond. Preiss is simply telling us to "take 5 steps north from home
      plate and dig".
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There are alternate interpretations of these lines, which treat them as
      the beginning. The gist being, start at the Boston Public Library where
      the names Thucydides and Xenophon are engraved on the wall (though let's
      not forget that those names are also on the wall of the Greek Pylon, next
      to Socrates, Pindar, and Apelles...), then go five subway stops or pass
      five wharfs, to lead to Langone Park. Although these may "work", it seems
      like forcing the details to fit the theory, rather than the other way
      around.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For example, there are actually 6 Wharfs between Columbus Park and Langone
      Park: Commercial, Lewis, Sargents, Union, Battery, and Constitution. I
      find it hard to believe that Preiss would expect us to know to "ignore"
      one of the wharfs, to count them as 5. At least harder to believe than the
      idea that Priess was referencing 1774 letter from an English author who
      wrote about fairy tales. It's also worth mentioning that 1774 Walpole
      letter was only a year before Paul Revere's ride (see above).

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One type that I have on my radar, but have not spent enough time
      analyzing, is the Literary Reference Stanza. Verses 2, 3, and 6, in
      particular, appear to have explicit references to works of literature,
      <cite>Treasure Island</cite> and <cite>Abroad in America</cite>
      respectively. There may even be as many as three more references to
      <cite>

      of Oz</cite>.
