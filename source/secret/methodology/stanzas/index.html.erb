      Once the verses have been
      <%= link_to "destructured into their composite stanzas",
                  current_page.data.verse_structure_path %>,
      it starts to become apparent that there are similarities in the stanzas
      from verse to verse.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the sections following, I will outline what I believe are the major
      Stanza categories, such as: the Starting Point Stanza; the Dig Site
      Stanza; the Locator Stanza; and the Waypoint Stanza.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Starting Point Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Within each verse, there is a stanza that describes the point where Preiss
      expected you to start your path to the casque. Both Verses 4 and 12 have
      the Starting Point Stanza as the first stanza. Prior to the Boston casque
      being found, I believed that the Starting Point Stanza was always the
      first stanza of the verse. As more information about the Boston solution
      comes to light, I'm not yet sure if it holds true for Verse 3.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It is interesting to note that with both Chicago and Cleveland, the
      Starting Point stanza corresponded to the entrance to the area of interest
      (i.e. Grant Park and the Cultural Gardens, respectively). As I analyze the
      Boston verse in more detail, I will be looking to see if this connection
      holds true.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 12, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Where M and B are set in stone<br>
        And to Congress, R is known
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 54" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One interesting point about this stanza is that it is presented as a
      couplet (2 lines), but if you split lines every 4 syllables, it matches
      the pattern of the Ballad Stanza. This might just be Preiss' stylistic
      influence coming through, but it is worth noting.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From the hints in the Japanese translation, we know that the M and B are
      the names of song composers. This leads us to the Chicago Symphony
      Orchestra building, where Mozart and Beethoven are engraved in the
      building. This is only about 350 yards from the entrance to Grant Park,
      where the Chicago casque was found.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Cleveland" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 4, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/04-cleveland/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Beneath two countries<br>
        As the road curves
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 50" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This couplet puts us on East Blvd, just outside the Parkgate Ave entrance
      to the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. The two countries referenced are Italy
      and Greece, since this stretch of East Blvd right before <q>the road
      curves</q> includes both the Greek and Italian Cultural Gardens. In this
      case, we are only about 250 feet from the casque location.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Boston" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      At the moment, this is a work in progress. I will update this section as
      I dig deeper into the Boston Verse.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Locator Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The purpose of a Locator Stanza is to orient you within an area on a map.
      This is very similar to my theory that there are
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Boundary Markers", current_page.data.boundary_markers_path,
                    class: %w(underline) %>
      </cite>
      within the paintings. This is the verse based equivalent. Preiss knew that
      maps would be one of the most readily available tools for narrowing down
      to a dig location. In many cases, the Locator Stanza, paired with the
      Boundary Markers from the Painting, then plotted on a map, give an
      extremely well-defined area of interest to search for the casque.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Since the Verses are non-linear (see above), the Locator Stanza has shown
      to be one of the more confusing stanza types. If attempting to read the
      verses linearly, as a step-by-step guide, when you reach the Locator
      Stanza, it will appear extremely out of place. It will read as if Preiss
      was telling you to go to one area and then immediately telling you to go
      somewhere else.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The Locator Stanza is relatively easy to spot, since Preiss used common
      key words to help identify them. Many of the verses have a stanza that
      uses one of: "near", "nearby", "not far way", etc. All of these vague
      spatial references are intended to help you narrow your focus to the area
      of interest. They are too vague to be useful if treating the verse
      in the step-by-step fashion. Near... How near?! The interpretation of
      "near" is often what sends people off, down an incorrect path.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 12, the Locator Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        For finding jewel casque<br>
        Seek the sounds<br>
        Of rumble<br>
        Brush and music<br>
        Hush.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 54" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This stanza refers to three things that you are to "seek", in order to
      get close to the casque's location: rumble; brush; and music. To solve the
      riddle of a Locator Stanza, we need to look at a map and find somewhere
      that these three things are seen together. In this case, rumble refers to
      the Railway Line, brush refers to the Art Institute, and music refers to
      a bandshell (or perhaps the Symphony Orchestra). Looking on a map, you
      can see where all of these things are found togeher.

        Old Location of the Bandshell in Grant Park.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this Verse, the Locator Stanza is also the last stanza. This aligns
      the the theory that the verses are not to be read in linear order, since
      you would not want to seek these things <em>after</em> having already
      found the 10 by 13 and the fence and fixture. If you passed the fence and
      fixture and continued in the direction of the Art Institute, you would
      pass right by the dig spot.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Cleveland" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For Verse 4, I believe that the Starting Point Stanza and the Locator
      Stanza are the same:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/04-cleveland/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Beneath two countries<br>
        As the road curves
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 50" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The reference to the curvature of the road is what hints towards this aslo
      acting as a Locator Stanza. If the interpretation of the Painting already
      has us looking in and around the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, it would not
      seem unreasonable to be looking at a map and see how Parkgate Ave curves
      right between the Greek and Italian Cultural Gardens.
    <% end %>

    <% figure_tag do %>
      <%= figure "images/secret/verses/04/locator_stanza.jpg" %>

      <% caption_tag number: 2 do %>
        Marker 1: Between two countries (Greek and Italian Gardens); Marker 2:
        Parkate Ave curves.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The most interesting piece is that the first two lines of Verse 4 have a
      dual meaning. That they both telling you the starting point and orient
      you on a map.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Locator: Boston" %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Waypoint Stanza" %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waypoint" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A waypoint is an intermediate point or place on a route or line of
        travel, a stopping point or point at which course is changed.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Wikipedia" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The Waypoint Stanza describes something that you pass on the way to the
      dig location. This is how Preiss lets you know that you are on the right
      path. The Waypoint Stanza is often the piece that ties a solve together,
      as it allows you to confirm that the path from the starting point to the
      dig location is correct.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Both the Chicago and Cleveland verses have prominent Waypoint Stanzas that
      were the key in getting to the dig site. It's also intersting to note that
      both of these Waypoint Stanzas actually make mention of the casque. For
      Verse 12, it's called the <q>treasure holder</q>, in Verse 4, it's just
      called <q>the casque</q>. I will look for this same pattern in other
      verse to help identify the Waypoint Stanzas.

  <% section_tag do %>

      For Verse 12, the Waypoint Stanza is:

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The L in question here is Lincoln, specifically a seated Lincoln statue in
      Grant Park. The identification of the Lincoln statue connected the dots
      from the Starting Point <q>Where M and B are set in stone</q> to the area
      behind the statue, where the casque was buried.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Dig Site Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The intent of the Dig Site Stanza is to tell you how to dig up the casque
      once you're in the right place. It is the "X marks the spot" of
      <cite>The Secret</cite>. In the cases of the 3 casques found, the Dig Site
      stanza was not the last stanza of the verse. In many of the other verses,
      the Dig Site stanza does appear to be at the end of the verse. There does
      not appear to be any pattern to where the it appears.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Some of the Dig Site stanzas are extremely explict, going so far as to
      give exact numbers of steps or exact placement with respect to particular
      bricks. In other cases, the Dig Site stanzas are very vague, more than
      likely telling us to use clues from the Painting, in conjuction with the
      verse, to get the dig instructions.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Dig Site: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      As mentioned at the beginning of this article, I believe the Dig Site
      Stanza for Verse 12 is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        The end of ten by thirteen<br>
        Is your clue<br>
        Fence and fixture<br>
        Central too

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 54" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There's a bit of disagreement over the <q>ten by thirteen</q>, most
      believe that it is related to the tree line, that it was telling you to go
      to the intersection of a line of ten trees with a line of thirteen trees.
      I've also heard that Priess mentioned it as ten by thirteen feet. In any
      case, it is an explicit direction for where to go and start to dig.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The additional lines about <q>fence and fixture</q> actually tie the verse
      to something that you see near the dig site and to something that you see
      in the Painting. The last line <q>Central too</q>, is a reference to the
      Chicago Central Railroad, that runs right past the dig site.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>

      I cannot say that this list of stanza types is exhaustive, as I am sure
      there is still a lot to uncover. There may still be other stanza types
      that are waiting to be identified.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One type that I have on my radar, but have not spent enough time analyzing
      is the Literary Reference Stanza. Verses 2 and 6, in particular, appear
      to have explicit references to works of literature,
      <cite>Treasure Island</cite> and <cite>Abroad in America</cite>
      repsectively. There may even be as many as three more references to
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Abroad in America",
                    current_page.data.abroad_in_america_path,

      within the verses at large.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Conclusion" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Understanding the intent of each stanza is the first step to solving the
      riddles that Priess has encoded within them. Applying this framework of
      Stanza types across the verses will hopefully shed light on what Priess
      was trying to communicate through the verses to get us to the casques.
