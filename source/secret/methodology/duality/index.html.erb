        A dozen paintings<br>
        Share the clues<br>
        Yet Fairies secrets<br>
        Come in twos<br>
        To sing a happy treasure song<br>
        To have a casque to you belong<br>
        Wed one picture<br>
        With one verse<br>
        For Fair Folk's peace<br>
        Goodness first.

      The above poem appears directly after the 12 images in the book. I want to
      draw attention to <q>Yet Fairies secrets / Come in twos</q>. On the
      surface, this just sounds like the author is setting you up for <q>Wed one
      picture / With one verse</q>. As you start to scratch the surface just a
      little bit, you start to see that there may be a deeper meaning to that
      one sentence.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There are a number of places in the book, the images, and the verses,
      where we start to see themes or patterns that occur two times. That may be
      visual references that appear in two images, poetic references that appear
      in two verses, or even references that cross from image to verse (or vice
      versa).
