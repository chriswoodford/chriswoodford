      At their root, the Verses of <cite>The Secret</cite> are poems. As poems,
      they are bound by many of the common poetic tropes: stanza, rhyme, meter,
      etc. I believe that we can use standard poetry analysis to learn more
      about the verses and better interpret the riddles found within. Below I
      will outline a few different general analyses of the verses.

    <%= section_title "Ballad Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each of the poems are different. It would be too easy to interpret them if
      they all followed an identical structure, say, like a Shakespearean
      Sonnet. That said, whether consciously or unconsciously, I think that
      Preiss did impart common structures and recurring themes into the verses.
      For example, he used the "Ballad Stanza" at least once, in almost every
      verse. The Ballad Stanza is defined as:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_stanza" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        In poetry, a Ballad stanza is the four-line stanza, known as a quatrain,
        most often found in the folk ballad. This form consists of alternating
        four- and three-stress lines. Usually only the second and fourth lines
        rhyme (in an a/b/c/b pattern). Assonance in place of rhyme is common.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Wikipedia" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Here's an example of a Ballad Stanza from Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Running north, but first across<br>
        In jewel's direction<br>
        Is an object<br>
        Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this example, you see that lines 2 and 4 rhyme, which follows the
      a/b/x/b pattern of the Ballad Stanza. Using this as a starting point, I
      can destructure the verses into their component stanzas and then highlight
      common themes and categorizations. Then, using the verses from the found
      casques as
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "case studies", current_page.data.stanzas_path,
          class: "underline" %>
      </cite>, I hope that this kind of analysis will help improve the
      interpretation of verses for casques that have not yet been found.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Destructuring Verses" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Although the Verses do not have any explicit separation, we can find
      implicit separation by identifying common poetic patterns. Preiss used a
      mix of many different poetic styles when writing the verses, from rhyming
      patterns like the Ballad Stanza to Free Verse, which follows the natural
      rhythm of the English language. This makes it difficult to apply any one
      pattern to all of the verses. Rather, each verse must be interpreted
      individually, paying attention to the particular nuances in order to
      determine the underlying structure.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One of the easier verses to deconstruct is Verse 7. It appears that most
      people tend to deconstruct this verse into couplets (i.e. stanzas of 2
      lines each), except the last 4 lines which are usually shown as a quatrain
      (i.e. a stanza of 4 lines).

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Keeping the Ballad Stanza in mind and analyzing the rhyming patterns
      shows that it can be deconstructed into 5 stanzas: 3 quatrains that follow
      the Ballad Stanza's a/b/x/b pattern (i.e. lines 2 and 4 rhyme, lines 1 and
      3 do not rhyme), and 2 couplets which are a/b (i.e. neither lines rhyme)
      and a/a (i.e. both lines rhyme) respectively.

      A structured version of Verse 7 looks like this:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>

      This analysis shows that the lines of each stanza are related in some way.
      I have seen many interpretations that pair <q>Near ace is high</q> with
      <q>Running north, but first across</q>, then drawing the conclusion that
      both lines are a reference to Highway 1 &mdash; which runs through Golden
      Gate Park in San Francisco, both North/South and East/West. My
      interpretation, based on the separation into these stanzas, holds that
      those two lines are unrelated. It shows that <q>Running north, but first
      across</q> is related to both the direction of the jewel and the object of
      Twain's attention, not to <q>ace is high</q>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There is a hint from Preiss in the Japanese edition that supports this
      idea. At minimum, it supports that the first and third lines of Stanza 2
      are related. In reference to <q>Education and Justice</q>, it says:

        Education and Justice. With only this it's hard to understand, I was
        told you should think of the phrase together with "..can be seen not
        far...". "(Education and Justice can be seen from not too far)" means..?

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This translation implies that the lines <q>Not far away</q> and
      <q>Education and Justice</q> go together; that
      <em>Education and Justice</em> <q>can be seen from</q>
      <em>not far away</em>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      I believe that this analysis shows that there is an underlying poetic
      structure within this Verse and points in the direction of further
      investigation into the remaining verses, to see how they can be
      deconstructed into stanzas.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the Verse destructured into its component parts, we can focus on the
      interpretation of each stanza. Applying this same process of destructuring
      to all of the Verses begins to show patterns, such that stanzas can be
      interpreted as offering a particular type of information for the quest. I
      get deeper into this idea in the next article about the different
      <cite>

      Before getting too deep into the

        <%= link_to "types of Stanzas",
                    current_page.data.stanzas_path, class: "underline" %>
      </cite>, I want to point out an underlying assumption that I hold: the
      Verses are not linear. That is, I do not believe that the verses are to be
      followed, line by line, in order, from beginning to end. Both Verse
      12 (Chicago) and Verse 4 (Cleveland) had the lines about the dig location
      in the middle of the verse, rather than the end.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For the Cleveland verse, the dig location instructions start at line 3,

      I believe that this non-linear structure strengthens my assertion that the
      individual stanzas must be analyzed separately, with respect to what piece
      of information they are giving the reader. Once the stanzas are properly
      understood for their intended purposes, they can then be reconstructed in
      a way that highlights the information particular to the dig location.

      Knowing the correct grouping of lines into stanzas is the best way to
      ensure a proper interpretation. That is, assuming that Preiss followed the
      commonly accepted elements of poetry. With an understanding of the
      underlying structure of these verses, we can better isolate and analyze
      the component pieces.
