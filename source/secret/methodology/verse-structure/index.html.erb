      At their root, the Verses of <cite>The Secret</cite> are poems. As poems,
      they are bound by many of the common poetic tropes: stanza, rhyme, meter,
      etc. We can use standard poetry analysis to learn more about the Verse and
      better interpret the riddles found within.

      Each of the poems are different. It would be too easy to interpret them if
      they all followed an identical structure, like a Shakespearean Sonnet.
      That said, whether consciously or unconsciously, Preiss did impart common
      structures and recurring themes into the verses. For example, he
      used the "Ballad Stanza" at least once, in almost every verse. The Ballad
      Stanza is defined as:

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_stanza" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        In poetry, a Ballad stanza is the four-line stanza, known as a quatrain,
        most often found in the folk ballad. This form consists of alternating
        four- and three-stress lines. Usually only the second and fourth lines
        rhyme (in an a/b/c/b pattern). Assonance in place of rhyme is common.

      Here's an example of a Ballad Stanza from Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Running north, but first across<br>
        In jewel's direction<br>
        Is an object<br>
        Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this example, you see that lines 2 and 4 rhyme, which follows the
      a/b/c/b pattern of the Ballad Stanza. Using this as a starting point, I
      will deconstruct all of the Verses into their composite stanzas and then
      highlight common themes and categorizations. Using the verses from the
      found casques as case studies, this analysis will help improve the
      interpretation of verses for casques that have no yet been found.
