      At their root, the Verses of <cite>The Secret</cite> are poems. As poems,
      they are bound by many of the common poetic tropes: stanza, rhyme, meter,
      etc. We can use standard poetry analysis to learn more about the Verse and
      better interpret the riddles found within.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each of the poems are different. It would be too easy to interpret them if
      they all followed an identical structure, like a Shakespearean Sonnet.
      That said, whether consciously or unconsciously, Preiss did impart common
      structures and recurring themes into the verses. For example, he
      used the "Ballad Stanza" at least once, in almost every verse. The Ballad
      Stanza is defined as:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_stanza" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        In poetry, a Ballad stanza is the four-line stanza, known as a quatrain,
        most often found in the folk ballad. This form consists of alternating
        four- and three-stress lines. Usually only the second and fourth lines
        rhyme (in an a/b/c/b pattern). Assonance in place of rhyme is common.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Here's an example of a Ballad Stanza from Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Running north, but first across<br>
        In jewel's direction<br>
        Is an object<br>
        Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this example, you see that lines 2 and 4 rhyme, which follows the
      a/b/x/b pattern of the Ballad Stanza. Using this as a starting point, I
      will deconstruct all of the Verses into their composite stanzas and then
      highlight common themes and categorizations. Using the verses from the
      found casques as case studies, this analysis will help improve the
      interpretation of verses for casques that have no yet been found.

    <%= section_title "Destructuring Verses" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Although the Verses do not have any explicit separation into stanzas, we
      can find implicit sepration by identifying common poetic patterns. Preiss
      used a mix of many different poetic styles when writing the verses, from
      rhyming patterns like the Ballad Stanza to Free Verse, which follows
      the natural rhythm of the english language. This makes it difficult to
      apply any one pattern to all of the verses. Rather, each verse must be
      interpreted individually, paying attention to the particular nuances in
      order to determine the underlying structure.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One of the easier verses to deconstruct is Verse 7. It appears that most
      people tend to deconstruct this verse into couplets (i.e. stanzas of 2
      lines each), except the last 4 lines which are usually shown as a quatrain
      (i.e. a stanza of 4 lines).

      Keeping the Ballad Stanza in mind and analzying the rhyming patterns
      shows that it can be deconstructed into 5 stanzas: 3 quatrains that follow
      the Ballad Stanza's a/b/x/b pattern (i.e. lines 2 and 4 rhyme, lines 1 and
      3 do not rhyme), and 2 couplets which are a/b (i.e. neither lines rhyme)
      and a/a (i.e. both lines rhyme) respectively.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      A structured version of Verse 7 looks like this:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: At stone wall's door<br>
        B: The air smells sweet
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Not far away<br>
        B: High posts are three<br>
        C: Education and Justice<br>
        B: For all to see
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Sounds from the sky<br>
        A: Near ace is high
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Running north, but first across<br>
        B: In jewel's direction<br>
        C: Is an object<br>
        B: Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Giant pole<br>
        B: Giant step<br>
        C: To the place<br>
        B: The casque is kept.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This shows that there is an underlying poetic structure within this Verse
      and points in the direction of further investigation into the remaining
      verses, to see how they can be deconstructed into stanzas.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It also implies that the lines of each stanza are related in some way. I
      have seen many interpretations that pair <q>Near ace is high</q> with
      <q>Running north, but first across</q>, then drawing the conclusion that
      both lines are a reference to Highway 1, that runs through Golden Gate
      Park in San Francisco, both North/South and East/West. This interpretation
      holds that those lines are unrelated, showing that <q>Running north, but
      first acorss</q> is related to both the direction of the jewel and the 
      object of Twain's attention.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the Verse destructured into it's component parts, we can focus on the
      interpretation of each stanza. Applying this same process of destructuring
      to all of the Verses begins to show patterns, such that stanzas can be
      interpreted as offering a particular category of information for the quest.
