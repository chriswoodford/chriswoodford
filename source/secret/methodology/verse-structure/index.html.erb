      At their root, the Verses of <cite>The Secret</cite> are poems. As poems,
      they are bound by many of the common poetic tropes: stanza, rhyme, meter,
      etc. We can use standard poetry analysis to learn more about the Verse and
      better interpret the riddles found within.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each of the poems are different. It would be too easy to interpret them if
      they all followed an identical structure, like a Shakespearean Sonnet.
      That said, whether consciously or unconsciously, Preiss did impart common
      structures and recurring themes into the verses. For example, he
      used the "Ballad Stanza" at least once, in almost every verse. The Ballad
      Stanza is defined as:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_stanza" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        In poetry, a Ballad stanza is the four-line stanza, known as a quatrain,
        most often found in the folk ballad. This form consists of alternating
        four- and three-stress lines. Usually only the second and fourth lines
        rhyme (in an a/b/c/b pattern). Assonance in place of rhyme is common.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Wikipedia" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Here's an example of a Ballad Stanza from Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Running north, but first across<br>
        In jewel's direction<br>
        Is an object<br>
        Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this example, you see that lines 2 and 4 rhyme, which follows the
      a/b/x/b pattern of the Ballad Stanza. Using this as a starting point, I
      will deconstruct all of the Verses into their composite stanzas and then
      highlight common themes and categorizations. Using the verses from the
      found casques as case studies, this analysis will help improve the
      interpretation of verses for casques that have no yet been found.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Destructuring Verses" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Although the Verses do not have any explicit separation into stanzas, we
      can find implicit sepration by identifying common poetic patterns. Preiss
      used a mix of many different poetic styles when writing the verses, from
      rhyming patterns like the Ballad Stanza to Free Verse, which follows
      the natural rhythm of the english language. This makes it difficult to
      apply any one pattern to all of the verses. Rather, each verse must be
      interpreted individually, paying attention to the particular nuances in
      order to determine the underlying structure.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One of the easier verses to deconstruct is Verse 7. It appears that most
      people tend to deconstruct this verse into couplets (i.e. stanzas of 2
      lines each), except the last 4 lines which are usually shown as a quatrain
      (i.e. a stanza of 4 lines).

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Keeping the Ballad Stanza in mind and analzying the rhyming patterns
      shows that it can be deconstructed into 5 stanzas: 3 quatrains that follow
      the Ballad Stanza's a/b/x/b pattern (i.e. lines 2 and 4 rhyme, lines 1 and
      3 do not rhyme), and 2 couplets which are a/b (i.e. neither lines rhyme)
      and a/a (i.e. both lines rhyme) respectively.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      A structured version of Verse 7 looks like this:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>

        B: The air smells sweet

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Not far away<br>
        B: High posts are three<br>
        C: Education and Justice<br>
        B: For all to see
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Sounds from the sky<br>
        A: Near ace is high
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Running north, but first across<br>
        B: In jewel's direction<br>
        C: Is an object<br>
        B: Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Giant pole<br>
        B: Giant step<br>
        C: To the place<br>
        B: The casque is kept.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This shows that there is an underlying poetic structure within this Verse
      and points in the direction of further investigation into the remaining
      verses, to see how they can be deconstructed into stanzas.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It also implies that the lines of each stanza are related in some way. I
      have seen many interpretations that pair <q>Near ace is high</q> with
      <q>Running north, but first across</q>, then drawing the conclusion that
      both lines are a reference to Highway 1, that runs through Golden Gate
      Park in San Francisco, both North/South and East/West. This interpretation
      holds that those lines are unrelated, showing that <q>Running north, but
      first acorss</q> is related to both the direction of the jewel and the
      object of Twain's attention.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the Verse destructured into it's component parts, we can focus on the
      interpretation of each stanza. Applying this same process of destructuring
      to all of the Verses begins to show patterns, such that stanzas can be
      interpreted as offering a particular category of information for the quest.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the sections following, I will outline the major Stanza categories,
      sucha as: the Starting Point Stanza; the Dig Site Stanza; the Locator
      Stanza; and the Waypoint Stanza.

    <%= section_title "Non-Linear Structure" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Before getting too deep into the different types of Stanzas, I want to
      point out an underlying assumption that I hold. The Verses are not linear.
      That is, I do not believe that the verses are to be followed, line by
      line, in order, from beginning to end. Both the Verse 12 (Chicago) and
      Verse 4 (Cleveland) had the lines about the dig location in the middle of
      the verse, rather than the end.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For the Cleveland verse, the dig location instructions start at line 3,
      appearing as the second stanza.

      For the Chicago verse, the dig location instructions start at line 7,
      appearing as the second last stanza..

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      I believe that this non-linear structure strengths my assertion that the
      individual stanzas must be analyzed separately, with respect to what piece
      of information they are giving the reader. Once the stanzas are properly
      understood for their context, they can then be reconstructed in a way that
      highlights the information particular to the dig location.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Starting Point Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Within each verse, there is a stanza that describes the point where Preiss
      expected you to start your path to the casque. Both Verses 4 and 12 have
      the Starting Point Stanza as the first stanza. Prior to the Boston casque
      being found, I believed that the Starting Point Stanza was always the
      first stanza of the verse. As more information about the Boston solution
      comes to light, I'm not yet sure if it holds true for Verse 3.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It is interesting to note that with both Chicago and Cleveland, the
      Starting Point stanza corresponded to the entrance to the area of interest
      (i.e. Grant Park and the Cultural Gardens, respectively). As I analyze the
      Boston verse in more detail, I will be looking to see if this connection
      holds true.

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_subtitle "Starting Point: Chicago" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 12, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Where M and B are set in stone<br>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 54" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One interesting point about this stanza is that it is presented as a
      couplet (2 lines), but if you split lines every 4 syllables, it matches
      the pattern of the Ballad Stanza. This might just be Preiss' stylistic
      influence coming through, but it is worth noting.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From the hints in the Japanese translation, we know that the M and B are
      the names of song composers. This leads us to the Chicago Symphony
      Orchestra building, where Mozart and Beethoven are engraved in the
      building. This is only about 350 yards from the entrance to Grant Park,
      where the Chicago casque was found.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This couplet puts us on East Blvd, just outside the Parkgate Ave entrance
      to the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. The two countries referenced are Italy
      and Greece, since this stretch of East Blvd right before <q>the road
      curves</q> includes both the Greek and Italian Cultural Gardens. In this
      case, we are only about 250 feet from the casque location.

  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Locator Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The purpose of a Locator Stanza is to orient you within an area on a map.
      This is very similar to my theory that there are
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Boundary Markers", current_page.data.boundary_markers_path,
                    class: %w(underline) %>
      </cite>
      within the paintings. This is the verse based equivalent. Preiss knew that
      maps would be one of the most readily available tools for narrowing down
      to a dig location. In many cases, the Locator Stanza, paired with the
      Boundary Markers from the Painting, then plotted on a map, give an
      extremely well-defined area of interest to search for the casque.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Since the Verses are non-linear (see above), the Locator Stanza has shown
      to be one of the more confusing stanza types. If attempting to read the
      verses linearly, as a step-by-step guide, when you reach the Locator
      Stanza, it will appear extremely out of place. It will read as if Preiss
      was telling you to go to one area and then immediately telling you to go
      somewhere else.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The Locator Stanza is relatively easy to spot, since Preiss used common
      key words to help identify them. Many of the verses have a stanza that
      uses one of: "near", "nearby", "not far way", etc. All of these vague
      spatial references are intended to help you narrow your focus to the area
      of interest. They are too vague to be useful if treating the verse
      in the step-by-step fashion. Near... How near?! The interpretation of
      "near" is often what sends people off, down an incorrect path.
    <% end %>

      For Verse 12, the Locator Stanza is:

        For finding jewel casque<br>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This stanza refers to three things that you are to "seek", in order to
      get close to the casque's location: rumble; brush; and music. To solve the
      riddle of a Locator Stanza, we need to look at a map and find somewhere
      that these three things are seen together. In this case, rumble refers to
      the Railway Line, brush refers to the Art Institute, and music refers to
      a bandshell (or perhaps the Symphony Orchestra). Looking on a map, you
      can see where all of these things are found togeher.

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this Verse, the Locator Stanza is also the last stanza. This aligns
      the the theory that the verses are not to be read in linear order, since
      you would not want to seek these things <em>after</em> having already
      found the 10 by 13 and the fence and fixture. If you passed the fence and
      fixture and continued in the direction of the Art Institute, you would
      pass right by the dig spot.

      For Verse 4, I believe that the Starting Point Stanza and the Locator

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The reference to the curvature of the road is what hints towards this aslo
      acting as a Locator Stanza. If the interpretation of the Painting already
      has us looking in and around the Cleveland Cultural Gardens, it would not
      seem unreasonable to be looking at a map and see how Parkgate Ave curves
      right between the Greek and Italian Cultural Gardens.

      The most interesting piece is that the first two lines of Verse 4 have a
