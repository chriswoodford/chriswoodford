      At their root, the Verses of <cite>The Secret</cite> are poems. As poems,
      they are bound by many of the common poetic tropes: stanza, rhyme, meter,
      etc. We can use standard poetry analysis to learn more about the Verse and
      better interpret the riddles found within.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each of the poems are different. It would be too easy to interpret them if
      they all followed an identical structure, like a Shakespearean Sonnet.
      That said, whether consciously or unconsciously, Preiss did impart common
      structures and recurring themes into the verses. For example, he
      used the "Ballad Stanza" at least once, in almost every verse. The Ballad
      Stanza is defined as:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballad_stanza" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        In poetry, a Ballad stanza is the four-line stanza, known as a quatrain,
        most often found in the folk ballad. This form consists of alternating
        four- and three-stress lines. Usually only the second and fourth lines
        rhyme (in an a/b/c/b pattern). Assonance in place of rhyme is common.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Wikipedia" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Here's an example of a Ballad Stanza from Verse 7:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Running north, but first across<br>
        In jewel's direction<br>
        Is an object<br>
        Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In this example, you see that lines 2 and 4 rhyme, which follows the
      a/b/x/b pattern of the Ballad Stanza. Using this as a starting point, I
      will deconstruct all of the Verses into their composite stanzas and then
      highlight common themes and categorizations. Using the verses from the
      found casques as case studies, this analysis will help improve the
      interpretation of verses for casques that have no yet been found.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Destructuring Verses" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Although the Verses do not have any explicit separation into stanzas, we
      can find implicit sepration by identifying common poetic patterns. Preiss
      used a mix of many different poetic styles when writing the verses, from
      rhyming patterns like the Ballad Stanza to Free Verse, which follows
      the natural rhythm of the english language. This makes it difficult to
      apply any one pattern to all of the verses. Rather, each verse must be
      interpreted individually, paying attention to the particular nuances in
      order to determine the underlying structure.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One of the easier verses to deconstruct is Verse 7. It appears that most
      people tend to deconstruct this verse into couplets (i.e. stanzas of 2
      lines each), except the last 4 lines which are usually shown as a quatrain
      (i.e. a stanza of 4 lines).

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Keeping the Ballad Stanza in mind and analzying the rhyming patterns
      shows that it can be deconstructed into 5 stanzas: 3 quatrains that follow
      the Ballad Stanza's a/b/x/b pattern (i.e. lines 2 and 4 rhyme, lines 1 and
      3 do not rhyme), and 2 couplets which are a/b (i.e. neither lines rhyme)
      and a/a (i.e. both lines rhyme) respectively.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      A structured version of Verse 7 looks like this:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-56/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: At stone wall's door<br>
        B: The air smells sweet
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Not far away<br>
        B: High posts are three<br>
        C: Education and Justice<br>
        B: For all to see
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Sounds from the sky<br>
        A: Near ace is high
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Running north, but first across<br>
        B: In jewel's direction<br>
        C: Is an object<br>
        B: Of Twain's attention
      <% end %>

      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A: Giant pole<br>
        B: Giant step<br>
        C: To the place<br>
        B: The casque is kept.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "The Secret: A Treasure Hunt",
                          reference: "pg. 52" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This shows that there is an underlying poetic structure within this Verse
      and points in the direction of further investigation into the remaining
      verses, to see how they can be deconstructed into stanzas.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      It also implies that the lines of each stanza are related in some way. I
      have seen many interpretations that pair <q>Near ace is high</q> with
      <q>Running north, but first across</q>, then drawing the conclusion that
      both lines are a reference to Highway 1, that runs through Golden Gate
      Park in San Francisco, both North/South and East/West. This interpretation
      holds that those lines are unrelated, showing that <q>Running north, but
      first acorss</q> is related to both the direction of the jewel and the
      object of Twain's attention.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the Verse destructured into it's component parts, we can focus on the
      interpretation of each stanza. Applying this same process of destructuring
      to all of the Verses begins to show patterns, such that stanzas can be
      interpreted as offering a particular category of information for the quest.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In the sections following, I will outline the major Stanza categories,
      sucha as: the Starting Point Stanza; the Dig Site Stanza; the Locator
      Stanza; and the Waypoint Stanza.

    <%= section_title "Non-Linear Structure" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Before getting too deep into the different types of Stanzas, I want to
      point out an underlying assumption that I hold. The Verses are not linear.
      That is, I do not believe that the verses are to be followed, line by
      line, in order, from beginning to end. Both the Verse 12 (Chicago) and
      Verse 4 (Cleveland) had the lines about the dig location in the middle of
      the verse, rather than the end.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For the Cleveland verse, the dig location instructions start at line 3,
      appearing as the second stanza.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      I believe that this non-linear structure strengths my assertion that the
      individual stanzas must be analyzed separately, with respect to what piece
      of information they are giving the reader. Once the stanzas are properly
      understood for their context, they can then be reconstructed in a way that
      highlights the information particular to the dig location.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Starting Point Stanza" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Within each verse, there is a stanza that describes the point where Preiss
      expected you to start your path to the casque. Across all of the verses,
      perhaps with the exception of Verse 6, the Starting Point Stanza is the
      first stanza. It is the only consistent structural element that I believe
      exists for all the verses.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Before the Boston casque was found, I believed that the Starting Point
      Stanza also corresponded to the entrance to the area of interest (i.e. the
      park). Both Chicago and Cleveland followed that pattern. Boston, however,
      appears to start at the Boston Public Library, around 2 miles from the
      park where the casque was found. The takeaway here is that the Starting
      Point of the path defined by the verse, may not necessarily be near the
      casque location.

      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 12, the first Stanza is:
    <% end %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/05-chicago/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        Where M and B are set in stone<br>

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One interesting point about this stanza is that it is presented as a
      couplet (2 lines), but if you split lines every 4 syllables, it matches
      the pattern of the Ballad Stanza. This might just be Preiss' stylistic
      influence coming through, but it is worth noting.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      From the hints in the Japanese translation, we know that the M and B are
      the names of song composers. This leads us to the Chicago Symphony
      Orchestra building, where Mozart and Beethoven are engraved in the
      building. This is only about 350 yards from the entrance to Grant Park,
      where the Chicago casque was found.

      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 4, the first Stanza is:

    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      This couplet puts us on East Blvd, just outside the Parkgate Ave entrance
      to the Cleveland Cultural Gardens. The two countries referenced are Italy
      and Greece, since this stretch of East Blvd right before <q>the road
      curves</q> includes both the Greek and Italian Cultural Gardens. In this
      case, we are only about 250 feet from the casque location.

      Looking at the Starting Point for Verse 3, the first Stanza is:

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://12treasures.com/11-boston/" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        If Thucydides is<br>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The opening stanza for verse 3 follows the Ballad Stanza, which is shown
      in the rhyme between <q>Xenophon</q> and <q>direction</q>. We believe that
      Thucydides and Xenophon refer to their names carved in stone at the
      Boston Public Library. Strikingly similar to the Starting Point Stanza for
      Verse 12.
