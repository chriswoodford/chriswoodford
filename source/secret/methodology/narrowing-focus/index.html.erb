      Imagine it's 1982. <cite>The Secret</cite> has just been released. Byron
      Preiss expects you to interpret an painting/verse pair, to get you to an
      exact location to dig up a buried treasure. There's no Google Maps, no
      Google Street View. There's barely even GPS, unless you're in the
      military.

      So what are the tools that he expected you to be able to solve these
      puzzles with?

      Unfortunately, <q>good, and kind, and playful</q> doesn't really help all

      You'll notice that I didn't mention "boots on the ground" investigation.
      That's because an element of these puzzles were intended to be an
      "armchair treasure hunt", i.e. you could, in theory, solve these puzzles
      without ever having left your house. This is referenced in "The Treasure"

      Preiss was open to the possibility that it could be solved without

      Ignoring all of the technological advances at our fingertips and thinking
      about how we would have had to approach this in 1982, I will outline a
      theory that the painting, verse, or both, offer a progressive narrowing of
      focus to guide the hunter as close as possible to the dig site, before
      requiring the boots on the ground investigation.

    <%= section_title "Narrow to the State" %>

      Each painting has a stylized depiction of the state where we are to place
      our initial focus. This is easier to see in some paintings, than in others.
      This is the most macro piece of information found in the paintings.

      A State is an extremely large area to cover for a treasure hunter, so it

      help get us closer to the right location.

    <%= section_title "Narrow to the City" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The next big breakthrough in narrowing focus came back in 2004 from a user
      on the Quest for Treasure forum named "fox". As far as I can tell, fox was
      the first to identify the
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "longitude/latitude pairs", current_page.data.lnglat_theory_url %>
      </cite>
      that are found in all (but one?) of the paintings.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Two longitude/latitude pairs will define a boundary box around a
      particular area. This is how we can narrow focus from an entire state to a
      precise city (or couple of cities).
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Below is an example from Image 1, showing the numbers that represent the
      latitude and longitude points. Within the hair, you can see the numbers
      37 and 38, which are the latitude points. Along the dress you can see
      Roman Numerals representing 122 and 123, which are the longitude points.
      Though, in order for the longitude points to actually point to the United
      States, we have to use -122 and -123.
    <% end %>

    <% figure_tag do %>
      <%= figure "images/secret/paintings/01/lng_lat.jpg" %>

      <% caption_tag number: 2 do %>
        37 and 38, representing the latitude are seen in the hair. 122 and 123,
        representing the longitude are seen in the dress.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Treating those numbers as max/min pairs of latitudes and longitudes will
      draw a bounding box around the city of San Francisco. The bounding box
      narrows our focus from an entire state, to a particular city (or
      cities...) within that state. In the picture below, you'll see that the
      Bay Area should be our area of focus.
    <% end %>

    <% figure_tag do %>
      <%= figure "images/secret/paintings/01/bounding_box.jpg" %>

      <% caption_tag number: 3 do %>
        San Francisco appears near the middle of the bounding box defined by the
        latitude and longitude points found in the painting.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Unfortunately the bounding box does not give us a 100% deterministic city
      to start searching in, i.e. is it San Francisco, or maybe Oakland? Since
      the area defined is still too large for someone to reasonably search for a
      buried treasure, we continue to look in the painting for information to
      help us to further narrow our investigation.

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      We learn on page 1 of the book that we are probably looking for a park (or
      something similar). Continuing with the above example of San Francisco,
      assuming we are able to rule out Oakland as an area of interest, there are
      223 public parks within the city limits of San Francisco. In 1982, It
      would have taken years to thoroughly investigate each one. There has to be
      a way to narrow our focus even more.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For this, I've taken a clue from the first Painting that we see in the
      book. It has two conspicuous symbols that look like symbols from a
      topographic map. Remember, <q>Fairies secrets / Come in twos</q>...
    <% end %>

        In topological maps, The square with a dot in the center represents a
        boundary marker; the triangle with a dot in the center is a
        horizontal control.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Given that this treasure hunt was conceived in 1982, maps were one of the
      most readily available sources of data for getting to a dig location. We
      already know that we are expected to be able to identify a state from its
      outline and interpret geo coordinates. It does not seem like a far stretch
      to assume that we are also expected to understand a few common map
      symbols. Let's look at some definitions of these symbols.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Horizontal Controls" %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/cast-bronze-benchmark" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        "horizontal control points" are points with precisely established
        latitude and longitude.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "United States Geological Survey (USGS)" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The triangle symbol is known as a horizontal control. From the definition
      above, it sounds like we have already determined that there are horizontal
      control points embedded in the painting. We have identified that there are
      four latitude and longitude points.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each latitude/longitude pair creates a precisely established point:
    <% end %>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
      <li>(min lat, min lng)</li>
      <li>(min lat, max lng)</li>
      <li>(max lat, min lng)</li>
      <li>(max lat, max lng)</li>
    </ul>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      These points are the horizontal controls hinted at by the presence of the
      triangle with the dot in the middle. They define the bounding box around
      the city-level area of interest.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Boundary Markers" %>

    <% blockquote_tag cite: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_marker" do %>
      <% paragraph_tag do %>
        A boundary marker, border marker, boundary stone, or border stone is a
        robust physical marker that identifies the start of a land boundary or
        the change in a boundary, especially a change in direction of a
        boundary.
      <% end %>

      <%= blockquote_cite source: "Wikipedia" %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      After having found something in the paintings that matches the horizontal
      control symbol, it seems reasonable to continue inspecting the paintings
      to see if there is anything that matches the definition of a boundary
      marker. This is where I believe the "iconic images" come into play.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Each painting has a number of images embedded within it, many of which are
      exact matches for physical things in the real world. Some of these, like
      the Chicago Water Tower in Painting 5 or Milwaukee City Hall in Painting
      10, are easier to spot. Others, like the Cleveland Terminal Tower in
      Painting 4 are harder to find, because you have to interpret the negative
      space between the trees. In both cases, the images are widely recognized
      and well-established icons in their respective cities.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      After identifying these iconic images, my hypothesis is that they are a
      reasonably good candidate for something that can be considered as a
      "boundary marker". As described above, boundary markers identify the start
      of a boundary, which in this interpretation, would be the start of the
      boundary around the park (or other public location) where the casque is
      buried. Narrowing our focus further, from the bounding box defined by the
      horizontal controls, to a more precise location.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      In order to test this hypothesis, the iconic images need to be plotted on
      a map and analyzed to determine if any important information can be
      learned.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Given that only two casques have been found so far, in Chicago and
      Cleveland, I always test my hypotheses on those two use cases first.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Chicago Boundary Markers" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There are at least three images in Painting 5 that are unrelated to the dig
      site, but that can be considered as iconic markers: the Chicago Water
      Tower, the Fountain of the Great Lakes, and Chicago Central Station.
      Even though the Chicago Central Station was demolished in 1974
      (approximately 6 years before Preiss buried the casque), you still see
      some of its features prominently in the painting. It would have been well
      known to anyone living in Chicago at the time.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      If we are going to treat these icons as boundary markers, we need to plot
      them on a map. I think it is reasonable to believe that this is something
      Preiss expected us to do. Especially for those trying to find the treasures
      from their armchairs.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Once plotted on the map, we can draw lines that represent the boundaries
      implied by the markers.
    <% end %>

    <% figure_tag do %>
      <%= figure "images/secret/paintings/05/boundary_markers.jpg" %>

      <% caption_tag number: 5 do %>
        Marker 1 is the Chicago Water Tower; Marker 2 is the Fountain of the
        Great Lakes; Marker 3 is Chicago Central Station.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Horizontally, Markers 1 and 3 define the northern and southern most
      boundaries, respectively. They focus our attention on an area that
      contains a small handful of parks as our potential areas of interest.
      The boundary defined by Marker 2 cuts horizontally through Grant Park.
      Vertically, The water line and Marker 1 define eastern and western
      boundaries.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The intersection of these boundary lines limits our area of interest to
      a small section of the city, east of Michigan Ave. It's pretty clear from
      the grid that Grant Park is where we should start investigating.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      At this point, looking within the boundaries, we would start to see
      connections to the
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Locator Stanza", current_page.data.locator_stanza_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>
      in Verse 12. <q>Seek the sounds / Of rumble / Brush and music</q>.
      We see that Marker 2 is cutting through the railroad tracks, the Art
      Institute, and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This tells us to go to the
      intersection of Marker 1 and Marker 2 to start our investigation.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      As we know, the intersection of Marker 1 and 2 is where you see that the
      names of Mozart and Beethoven are set in stone on the wall of the Symphony
      Orchestra, which coincides with Line 1 of the
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "Starting Point Stanza",
                    current_page.data.starting_point_stanza_path,
                    class: "underline" %>
      </cite>,
      <q>Where M and B are set in stone</q>. Steps away we see Roosevelt
      University and Congress Parkway, which aligns with Line 2 of the Starting
      Point Stanza, <q>And to Congress, R is known</q>.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With the Starting Point Stanza confirmed within the boundaries defined by
      the iconic imagines, it is pretty certain that the casque is buried in
      Grant Park. Luckily, since this is one of the casques that was found, we
      can confirm with certainty that Grant Park is correct.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Cleveland Boundary Markers" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      There are at least 2 iconic images in Painting 4, associated with
      Cleveland. The first, the Cleveland Terminal Tower, is an exact match
      outline found in the negative space between the trees in the background.
      The second, a sphere with a triangle on it, is a bit more obtuse of a
      clue. This icon is generally interpreted as a reference to Euclid, the
      Greek Mathematician known for being the <q>Father of Geometry</q>, whose
      namesake Euclid Ave. runs through the city of Cleveland.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Applying the same technique of plotting the iconic images on a map and
      drawing the boundary lines produces the map below:
    <% end %>

    <% figure_tag do %>
      <%= figure "images/secret/paintings/04/boundary_markers.jpg" %>

      <% caption_tag number: 6 do %>
        Marker 1 is the Cleveland Terminal Tower; Marker 2 is Euclid Ave, as it
        runs southwest towards the Terminal Tower.
      <% end %>
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Horizontally, Marker 1 defines the southern boundary while the water line
      defines the northern border. Marker 2 cuts diagonally from the north until
      it intersects with the boundary from Marker 1, defining both southern and
      eastern boundaries. After the intersection point, Euclid Ave runs parallel
      to the Marker 1 boundary. Vertically, Marker 1 defines the western
      boundary.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Again, we see that the boundaries focus our area of interest to a small
      section of the city, with only a few candidate parks to investigate. Right
      above the intersection of the Marker 1 and Marker 2 boundaries, we see
      the Cleveland Cultural Gardens.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      As we narrow in on the Cultural Gardens, we see a connection to the
      Starting Point Stanza of Verse 4 (which also happens to be the Map Locator
      Stanza). The curve of Parkgate Ave aligns to the line <q>As the road
      curves</q>. From here, we would know to continue our search in the
      Cultural Gardens.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The next steps are to apply this same technique to the remaining Paintings
      and see if it confirms or denies any of the prevailing theories about
      areas of interest. It may even point us in the direction of new areas that
      had not previously been considered!
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Criticism" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With only two casques uncovered, there really is no way to show whether
      this theory is valid or not, without using it to find more casques. Right
      now all "solves" for casque locations are still just theories. That said,
      I want to run through a couple criticisms to the Narrowing Focus theory to
      further flush out my ideas.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      One criticism of the Narrowing Focus theory is that the iconic images can
      get you to the city, without the need for the state outline or the
      bounding box. This was proven in practice by the folks who found the
      Chicago casque. The key point of reference for them was the Chicago Water
      Tower, and that got them to their city.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The claim above is irrefutable. I cannot deny that they were able to skip
      straight to Chicago once they saw the Water Tower. The iconic images are
      iconic for a reason! Especially for someone who lives in the city of the
      iconic image. But we know that this treasure hunt was intended for a more
      broad audience, who might not even have realized that was the iconic
      Chicago Water Tower until after they narrowed to Illinois and then started
      looking at maps and pictures of Chicago. One thing that I can say, is that
      the presence of the state outline and the bounding box show that Preiss
      had something else in mind. If he truly thought that the iconic images
      were enough information to get someone to the dig location, then there
      would be no reason to include the state and geocoordinates at all.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      Another criticism, stems from the fact that the horizontal and boundary
      marker symbols are on Painting 1, but not all the paintings. That may mean
      that it is referencing particular boundary markers in the San Francisco
      area, for example, the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway or the
      boundary markers at Ocean Beach.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      To this, I would just say that it is interesting that it is on Painting 1.
      Preiss would have known that this is likely the first painting that we
      would see and it is possible that he encoded extra information into this
      Painting on purpose, to help get us started.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      With respect to the symbols being on Painting 1, I think that is not
      necessarily true. Painting 2 has very prominent "circle with a dot inside"
      symbols on the fairy's wings. These could represent the topological symbol
      for "Located or landmark object". We also see a similar "square with a dot
      inside" on Painting 11, below her right elbow (on the left side of the
      painting). I think there is a lot of room for a deeper investigation into
      the meaning of these symbols, and whether they add further weight to this
      theory.
    <% end %>
  <% end %>

  <% section_tag do %>
    <%= section_title "Conclusion" %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      For this theory to work, interpretation is key. If we had interpreted the
      Euclidean Triangle in Painting 4 as something else, say, representing the
      Holy Trinity, it would have lead us to a different set of boundaries. If
      the interpretation of the iconic images is incorrect, then the boundaries
      will be incorrect.
    <% end %>

    <% paragraph_tag do %>
      The important takeaway here is that the boundaries can be defined. We can
      apply the boundaries in the same way across multiple interpretations and
      see which areas of interest best align with the Painting and the Verse. It
      is only when everything lines up just right, and with such ease, that we
      find the right place to look for the casque.
