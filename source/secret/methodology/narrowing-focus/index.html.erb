    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p class="pb-4">
      Imagine it's 1982. <cite>The Secret</cite> has just been released. Byron
      Preiss expects you to interpret an painting/verse pair, to get you to an
      an exact location to dig up a buried treasure. There's no Google Maps, no
      Google Street View. There's barely even GPS, unless you're in the
      military.
    </p>

    <p class="pb-4">
      So what are the tools that he expected you to be able to solve these
      puzzles with?

      <blockquote cite="https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-32/">

          In our land and in our time, the Fair People and<br>
          their treasures yet wait to be discovered. If Man is<br>
          good, and kind, and playful, he and she will find<br>
          them.<br>
          That is The Secret.

    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Unfortunately <q>good, and kind, and playful</q> doesn't really help all
      that much. Maybe <q>playful</q> refers to a certain amount of whimsy
      required for interpreting the verses, but it's really hard to say.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Realisitcally, the expected toolset looked more like:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>City Maps</li>
      <li>Tourist Maps</li>
      <li>Knowledge of Iconic Landmarks</li>
      <li>Libraries</li>
      <li>Newspapers</li>
      <li>Encyclopaedias</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="pt-4">
      You'll notice that I didn't mention "boots on the ground" investigation.
      That's because an element of these puzzles were intended to be an
      "armchair treasure hunt", i.e. you could, in theory, solve these puzzles
      without ever having left your house. This is referenced in "The Treasure"
      section at the back of the book.

    <p class="pt-4">
      Preiss was open to the possibility that it could be solved without
      exploring. I mean, why else would they have done a Japanese edition, if
      there was no chance that it could be solved without actually being there.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Ignoring all of the technological advances at our fingertips and thinking
      about how we would have had to approach this in 1982, I will outline a
      theory that the painting, verse, or both, offer a progressive narrowing of
      focus to guide the hunter as close as possible to the dig site, before
      requiring the boots on the ground investigation.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h2>Narrow to the State</h2>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Each painting has a stylized depiction of the state where we are to place
      our initial focus. This is easier to see in some paintings, than in others.
      This is the most macro piece of information found in the paintings.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Here is an example from Image 5, showing an outline of the state of
      Illinois.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "images/secret/paintings/05/illinois.jpg" %>
      <figcaption>
        Compare the outline in the image on the left to the state outline on the
        right. Image 5 has been flipped horizontally.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="pt-4">
      A State is an extremely large area to cover for a treasure hunter, so it
      seems fair to assume that this is just the first of a set of clues to
      help get us closer to the right location.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h2>Narrow to the City</h2>

    <p class="pt-4">
      The next big breakthrough in narrowing focus came back in 2004 from a user
      on the Quest for Treasure forum named "fox". As far as I can tell, fox was
      the first to identify the
      <cite>
        <%= link_to "longitude/latitude pairs", current_page.data.lnglat_theory_url %>
      </cite>
      that are found in all (but one?) of the paintings.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Two longitude/latitude pairs will define a boundary box around a
      particular area. This is how we can narrow focus from an entire state to a
      precise city (or couple of cities).
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Below is an example from Image 1, showing the numbers that represent the
      latitude and longitude points. Within the hair, you can see the numbers
      37 and 38, which are the latitude points. Along the dress you can see
      Roman Numerals representing 122 and 123, which are the longitude points.
      Though, in order for the longitude points to actually point to the United
      States, we have to use -122 and -123.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "images/secret/paintings/01/lng_lat.jpg" %>
      <figcaption>
        37 and 38, representing the latitude are seen in the hair. 122 and 123,
        representing the longitude are seen in the dress.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Treating those numbers as max/min pairs of latitudes and longitudes will
      draw a bounding box around the city of San Francisco. The bounding box
      narrows our focus from an entire state, to a particular city (or
      cities...) within that state. In the picture below, you'll see that the
      Bay Area should be our area of focus.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "images/secret/paintings/01/bounding_box.jpg" %>
      <figcaption>
        San Francisco appears near the middle of the bounding box defined by the
        latitude and longitude points found in the painting.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Unfortunately the bounding box does not gives us a 100% deterministic city
      to start searching in, i.e. is it San Francisco, or maybe Oakland? Since
      the area defined is still too large for someone to reasonably search for a
      buried treasure, we continue to look in the painting for information to
      help us to further narrow our investigation.

    <h2>Narrow to the General Location</h2>

    <blockquote cite="https://12treasures.com/2018/12/24/the-secret-1/">

        A quest for twelve treasures: over ten thousand<br>
        dollars in precious jewels. They may be hidden in<br>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="pt-4">
      We learn on page 1 of the book that we are probably looking for a park (or
      something similar). Continuing with the above example of San Francisco,
      assuming we are able to rule out Oakland as an area of interest, there are
      223 public parks within the city limits of San Francisco. In 1982, It
      would have taken years to thoroughly investigate each one. There has to be
      a way to narrow our foucs event more.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      For this, I've taken a clue from the first Painting that we see in the
      book. It has two conspicuous symbols that look like symbols from a
      topographic map.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <%= image_tag "images/secret/paintings/01/topographical_symbols.jpg" %>
      <figcaption>
        In topological maps, The square with a dot in the center represents a
        boundary marker; the triangle with a dot in the center is a
        horizontal control.
    </figure>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Given that this treasure hunt was conceived in 1982, maps were one of the
      most readily available sources of data for getting to a dig location. We
      already know that we are expected to be able to identify a state from its
      outline and interpret geocoordinates. It does not seem like a far stretch
      to assume that we are also expected to understand map symbols. Let's look
      at some definitions of these symbols.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h3>Horizontal Controls</h3>

    <blockquote cite="https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/cast-bronze-benchmark">
      <p>
        "horizontal control points" are points with precisely established
        latitude and longitude.
      </p>

      <footer>
        <cite>&ndash; United States Geological Survey (USGS)</cite>
      </footer>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="pt-4">
      From the definition above, it sounds like we have already determined the
      horizontal control points embeded in the painting when we identified the
      four latitude and longitude points. Each pair of points: (min lat, min
      lng), (min lat, max lng), (max lat, min lng), and (max lat, max lng) would
      be our horizontal controls, since they are precisely establed latitude and
      longitude.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h3>Boundary Markers</h3>

    <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_marker">
      <p>
        A boundary marker, border marker, boundary stone, or border stone is a
        robust physical marker that identifies the start of a land boundary or
        the change in a boundary, especially a change in direction of a
        boundary.
      </p>

    </blockquote>

    <p class="pt-4">
      After having found something in the paintings that matches the horizontal
      control symbol, it seems reasonable to continue inspecting the paintings
      to see if there is anything that matches the definition of a boundary
      marker. This is where I believe the "iconic images" come into play.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Each painting has a number of images embeded within it. Some of these,
      like the Chicago Water Tower in Painting 5 or Milwaukee City Hall in
      Painting 10, are easier to spot. Others, like the Cleveland Terminal Tower
      in Painting 4 are harder to find, because you have to interpret the
      negative space between the trees. In both cases, the images are widely
      recognized and well-established markers in their respective cities.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      After identifying these iconic markers, my hypothesis is that they are a
      reasonably good candidate for something that can be considered as a
      "boundary marker" to further narrow focus to a general location (e.g. a
      particular park). In order to test this hypothesis, the iconic images need
      to be plotted on a map and analyzed to determine if any important
      information can be learned.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      Given that only two casques have been found so far, in Chicago and
      Cleveland, I always test my hypotheses on those two use cases first.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h4>Chicago Boundary Markers</h4>

    <p class="pt-4">
      There are at least three images in Painting 5 that are unrelated to the dig
      site, but that can be considered as iconic markers: the Chicago Water
      Tower, the Fountain of the Great Lakes, and Chicago Central Station.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-4 pt-4">
    <h2>Criticism</h2>

    <p class="pt-4">
      One criticism of the Narrowing Focus theory is that the iconic images can
      get you to the city, without the need for the state outline or the
      bounding box. This was proven in practice by the folks who found the
      Chicago casque. The key point of reference for them was the Chicago Water
      Tower, and that got them to their city.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      The claim above is irrefutable. I cannot deny that they were able to skip
      straight to Chicago once they saw the Water Tower. The iconic images are
      iconic for a reason! Especially for someone who lives in the city of the
      iconic image. But we know that this treasure hunt was intended for a more
      broad audience, who might not even have realized that was the iconic
      Chicago Water Tower until after they narrowed to Illinois and then started
      looking at maps and pictures of Chicago. One thing that I can say, is that
      the presence of the state outline and the bounding box show that BP had
      something else in mind. If he truly thought that the iconic images were
      enough information to get someone to the dig location, then there would be
      no reason to include the state and geocoordinates at all.
    </p>

    <p class="pt-4">
      ...Another criticism, boundary marker is a reference to the western terminus of the lincoln highway or ocean beach...
